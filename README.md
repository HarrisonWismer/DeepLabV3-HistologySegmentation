# DeepLabV3 - H&E Segmentation

These scripts implements the DeepLabV3+ model for multi-class semantic segmentation as outlined in:

[Chen, LC., Zhu, Y., Papandreou, G., Schroff, F., Adam, H. (2018). Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation. In: Ferrari, V., Hebert, M., Sminchisescu, C., Weiss, Y. (eds) Computer Vision â€“ ECCV 2018. ECCV 2018. Lecture Notes in Computer Science(), vol 11211. Springer, Cham](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01234-2_49)

Large amounts of code for data loading and model architecture creation were taken and either used directly or were slightly adapted from the keras examples page:
